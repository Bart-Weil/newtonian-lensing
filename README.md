Gravitational lensing simulated using discrete time newtonian model.

Build with: make clean scene

Most scene settings are clearly given in scene.c, black hole masses and schwarzchild radii must be manually altered in lensing.c. Be sure to alter N_BODIES when adding black holes, found in lensing.h.
